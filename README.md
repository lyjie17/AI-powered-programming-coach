# AI-powered-programming-coach

This project is an interactive programming learning platform powered by Streamlit and OpenAI's API. Users can learn Python, JavaScript, Java, and C++ through interactive lessons, run code in a built-in execution environment, and receive AI-powered feedback on their coding exercises.

## Features
- **Multi-Language Support**: Learn Python, JavaScript, Java, and C++.
- **AI-Generated Learning Paths**: Personalized lessons created based on your current knowledge and learning goals.
- **Code Practice and Execution**: Run your code directly in the app for immediate results.
- **AI Feedback**: Get detailed feedback on your code to improve and learn best practices.

## Setup
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Set up your `.env` file:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add your OpenAI API key there:
     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
3. Run the app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app_runner.py
   ```

## Usage
1. From the sidebar on your left, select your preferred programming language and enter your current knowledge and learning goals.
3. Click "Generate Learning Path" button and then wait for a learning path generated by AI for you; if there is error when generating a path, click "Generate Learning Path" again.
4. After completing exercises, click "APPLY" or type "CMD+ENTER" to save the code.
5. Use the "Run Code" button to execute code or "Get AI Feedback" to improve your solutions.
6. Move to next lesson by clicking "Next Button" button or review previous lesson by "Previous Button".
